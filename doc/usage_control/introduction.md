# Introduction

Usage control is a promising approach for access control in open, distributed,
heterogeneous and network-connected computer environments. It encompasses and
enhances traditional access control models, Trust Management (TM) and Digital
Rights Management (DRM), and its main novelties are mutability of attributes and
continuity of access decision evaluation. You can check more information in
this [repository](https://github.com/ging/fiware-usage-control).

The FIWARE Identity Manager Keyrock plays the role of PAP (Policy Administration
Point) and PIP (Policy Information Point) in the Usage Control Architecture. It
offers the possibility of defining data usage rules and the corresponding
punishments for each application. These rules must be fulfilled by data
consumers.
