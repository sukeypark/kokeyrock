# Configuration description

Keyrock is a powerful tool that could be easy configured to suit up with the
specific needs of each use case. These are the main configurations:

-   Host and port.

-   Debug.

-   HTTPS.

-   Security (user session, password encryption and CORS).

-   OAuth2.

-   eIDAS.

-   API.

-   Database.

-   External authentication.

-   Authorization.

-   Mail Server.

-   Email filtering.

-   Site (themes).

All this configurations could be done using environment variables. To check the
list of environment vairables go to the next section.

Apart from the config.js file, the UI has an aministration user view from which
users could be easily managed.

## Host and Port

These are the basic configurations of Keyrock. The first configuration is to
indicate in which port will be Keyrock listenning if HTTPS is not enabled. Host
configuration is to indicate the domain name of Keyrock in prodoction. Otherwise
it should be set to `http://localhost:` when running on development.

```javascript
config.port = 80;
config.host = "http://keyrock-domain-name.org:" + config.port;
```

## Debug

Enable this configuration to display logs related to requests of resources or
performed SQL statements with the database.

```javascript
config.debug = true;
```

In addition, you can run Keyrock in debug mode with the following shell command:

```bash
npm run debug
```

To run this command is mandatory to install [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which
will restart server anytime a change the code changes.

## Enable HTTPS

Follow the next steps in order to enable the server to listen to HTTPS requests.

-   Generate OpenSSL certificates.

```bash
./generate_openssl_keys.sh
```

-   Enable HTTPS in config.js.

```javascript
config.https = {
    enabled: true,
    cert_file: "certs/idm-2018-cert.pem",
    key_file: "certs/idm-2018-key.pem",
    port: 443
};
```

-   Start server with admin rights

```bash
sudo npm start
```

## Security

Apart from HTTPS there are other 3 configurations related to handle security:

-   Session management. This parameter is used to set the key to encrypt user
    sessions in the UI and the duration of the user session. For security
    reasons, it is recommended to create a random key any time the server is
    restarted. For instance:

```javascript
config.session = {
    secret: require("crypto")
        .randomBytes(20)
        .toString("hex"),
    expires: 60 * 60 * 1000
};
```

-   Password encryption. Currently salt password is supported in Keyrock so this
    parameter will be deprecated in the future. Anyway this could be configured
    to encrypt password in case a developer decided not to use salt passwords.

```javascript
config.password_encryption = {
    key: "idm_encryption"
};
```

-   CORS. This allows Keyrock to manage requests coming from another domain
    different to Keyrock's one. Through this configuration you can indicate
    which HTTP methods will be allowed, from which domain could requests come,
    etc. This is the default CORS configuration:

```javascript
config.cors = {
    enabled: true,
    options: {
        origin: "*",
        methods: ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "PATCH", "POST", "DELETE"],
        allowedHeaders: undefined,
        exposedHeaders: undefined,
        credentials: undefined,
        maxAge: undefined,
        preflightContinue: false,
        optionsSuccessStatus: 204
    }
};
```

## OAuth2.0

Some features of Keyrock could be configured. Most of them are related to
lifetime of tokens.

-   Authorization code, access token and refresh token lifetimes could be
    changed easily. If you change one of this values it means that all services
    register in Keyrock will be updated with this nea values.

-   Ask authorization. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forces
    clients to ask for a consent to obtain the user information. Actually, this
    parameter should be always true, but there are some cases in which is useful
    to set it to false. For instance, if a service in which existing users have
    already gave their consent before and now this service wants to use Keyrock
    but with their own user table to authenticate those users(see External
    authentication).

-   Unique URL. Currently, Keyrock allows to register services with the same
    URL. In case a Service has not included Sign-out Callback URL Keyrock will
    redirect sign out requests to the address stored in URL attribute. So, if
    unique URL is not enable, some sign-out process could fail due to bad
    request redirections.

```javascript
config.oauth2 = {
    authorization_code_lifetime: 5 * 60,
    access_token_lifetime: 60 * 60,
    ask_authorization: true,
    refresh_token_lifetime: 60 * 60 * 24 * 14,
    unique_url: false
};
```

to obtain a whole description of this feature.

## eIDAS

Check
[Connecting IdM to eIDAS](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eidas/introduction/index.html)
to obtain a whole description of this feature. An example of this configuration
is:

```javascript
config.eidas = {
    enabled: true,
    gateway_host: "localhost",
    node_host: "https://se-eidas.redsara.es/EidasNode/ServiceProvider",
    metadata_expiration: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
};
```

## Usage Control

Check
[data usage control section](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_control/introduction/index.html)
to obtain a whole description of this feature. An example of this configuration
is:

```javascript
config.usage_control = {
    enabled: true,
    ptp: {
        host: "localhost",
        port: 8090
    }
};
```

## API

As in OAuth2.0 configuration, the API token lifetime could be changed to be
shorter or larger based on the individual need of each Keyrock instance
deployed.

The API of keyrock to manage its own resources can be configure slightly

```javascript
config.api = {
    token_lifetime: 60 * 60
};
```

## Database

There are several parameters related to the database configuration that could be
change:

-   Host. Is the domain name or IP of the machine in which the database is
    running.

-   Port. If not configured, the port assigned is the default one for each SQL
    dialect. For instance, MySQL use 3306 por by default.

-   Username and password. Some databases dialects as MySQL or Postgres needs to
    authenticate an entity before performing actions against the database.

-   Dialect. This paramter indicates which type SQL database is going to be
    used.

```javascript
config.database = {
    host: "localhost",
    password: "idm",
    username: "root",
    database: "idm",
    dialect: "mysql",
    port: undefined
};
```

## External Authentication

You can also configure the Identity Manager to authenticate users through an
external database.

When using this option, after the user correclty authenticates using his/her
remote credentials, a local copy of the user is created. For authenticating the
user externally Keyrock needs to read a set of user attributes from the external
database. These attributes are:

-   id: A unique identifier of the user. The local copy of the user will have an
    identifier with the result of concatenating the configured prefix
    (_config.external_auth.id_prefix_) and the external ID.

-   username: the display name of the user.

-   email: the email address is the value used for authenticating the user.

-   password: the encrypted password of the user.

-   password_salt: if not specified, the value set in
    `config.external_auth.password_encryption_key` will be used for checking the
    password encryption.

It is very common that the external database does not have a table with these
parameters. In such case you can create a database view for exposing them.

If your external database has the user data separated in two tables named
_USERS_ and _ACTORS_ with the following structure:

**USERS Table**

```text
| ID  | encrypted_password | password_salt | created_at               | last_sign_in_at          | actor_id |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| 1   | g34h432hjk54k2j    | 1234          | 2015-06-10 08:26:02.0113 | 2018-06-10 08:26:02.0113 | 12       |
| 2   | 2h43h7fdj38302j    | 1234          | 2015-01-10 08:26:02.0113 | 2018-01-10 08:26:02.0113 | 22       |
| 3   | j328478j328j423    | 1234          | 2015-02-10 08:26:02.0113 | 2018-10-10 08:26:02.0113 | 5        |
```

**ACTORS Table**

```text
| ID  | name          | email           | logo                   |
| --- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 12  | Melinda López | melinda@test.es | http://mylogo.es/12344 |
| 22  | Juanli Jons   | juanli@test.es  | http://mylogo.es/12121 |
| 5   | Lesha Magnen  | lesha@test.es   | http://mylogo.es/1212  |
```

You can create a view with the SQL statement

```sql
CREATE VIEW USER_VIEW AS
    SELECT USERS.id, USERS.password_salt, USERS.encrypted_password as password, ACTORS.email, ACTORS.name as username
    FROM USERS,ACTORS
    WHERE USERS.actor_id = ACTORS.id;
```

And this will create a view with the structure Keyrock needs to authenticate
users:

**USER_VIEW Table**

| ID  | password_salt | password        | email           | username      |
| --- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | 1234          | g34h432hjk54k2j | melinda@test.es | Melinda López |
| 2   | 1234          | 2h43h7fdj38302j | juanli@test.es  | Juanli Jons   |
| 3   | 1234          | j328478j328j423 | lesha@test.es   | Lesha Magnen  |

For enabling this external authentication you have to modify config.js file
customizing the database attributes.

```javascript
config.external_auth = {
    enabled: true,
    id_prefix: "external_",
    password_encryption_key: undefined,
    ecryption: "bcyrpt",
    database: {
        host: "localhost",
        port: undefined,
        database: "idm",
        username: "root",
        password: "idm",
        user_table: "user_view",
        dialect: "mysql"
    }
};
```

The way to check password validity can be customized in with parameter
_external_auth.encryption_. SHA1 and BCrypt are currently supported.

## Authorization

Configure Policy Decision Point (PDP)

-   IdM can perform basic policy checks (HTTP verb + path).

-   AuthZForce can perform basic policy checks as well as advanced.

If authorization level is advanced you can create rules, HTTP verb+resource and
XACML advanced. In addition you need to have an instance of authzforce deployed
to perform advanced authorization request from a Pep Proxy. If authorization
level is basic, only HTTP verb+resource rules can be created

In order to allow this characteristic you need to edit the config file:

```javascript
config.authorization = {
    level: "basic", // basic|advanced
    authzforce: {
        enabled: false,
        host: "localhost",
        port: 8080
    }
};
```

## Email

You can configure the IdM to send emails to users. Follow this
[tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-as-a-send-only-smtp-server-on-ubuntu-14-04)
to configure Postfix as a Send-Only SMTP Server on Ubuntu 14.04. Then edit
config file:

```javascript
config.mail = {
    host: "idm_host",
    port: 25,
    from: "noreply@host"
};
```

## Email filtering

In order to increase control over who is sign up in Keyrock you can configure an
email domain filter. There are two approaches:

-   whitelist. It is a list in which you define valid email domains that can
    register in Keyrock.

-   blacklist. It is a list in which you define which email domains are going to
    be block when registering in Keyrock.

Once you have decided which approach use, you need to fill the corresponding
file under /etc/email_list. These lists should have a domain(withour @) per
line. For instance, a whitelist would be like:

```txt
allow.com
valid.es
permit.com
```

If this parameter is set to null or undefined it means that there won't be
performed any email domail filtering. Example of configuration:

```javascript
config.email_list_type = "whitelist";
```

## Configure themes

You can customize the appearance of the web portal. By default there are two
themes: default and fiwarelab.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/AdminGuide_default_view.png)

<p align="center">Figure 1: IdM default view</p>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/AdminGuide_fiware_view.png)

<p align="center">Figure 2: IdM fiware view</p>

You can change between these themes in config.js

```javascript
config.site = {
    title: "Identity Manager",
    theme: "default" // default/fiwarelab
};
```

Additionally you can customize your own theme. In order to do that follow these
steps:

-   Create a new subfolder in themes directory

```bash
mkdir themes/example
```

-   Generate \_colors.scss, \_styles.scss and style.scss

```bash
cd themes/example && touch _colors.scss _styles.scss style.scss
```

-   Add these lines to style.scss

```css
/****************************** Default colors */
@import "../default/colors";

/****************************** Custom colors */
@import "colors";

/****************************** Default styles */
@import "../default/styles_call";

/****************************** Custom styles */
@import "styles";
```

-   Edit \_colors.scss. For example:

```css
/****************************** Custom colors rewrite */

$brand-primary: purple;
$brand-secundary: orange;
```

-   Change config.site to use the new theme:

```javascript
config.site = {
    title: "Identity Manager",
    theme: "example" // default/fiwarelab
};
```

Run again Keyrock to see the new appearance:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/AdminGuide_customize_view.png)

<p align="center">Figure 3: IdM custom view</p>

You can also configure a new logo in \_styles.scss.

```css
/****************************** Custom styles rewrite */

.logo-header .brand {
    background-image: url(../img/example.png);
    width: 150px;
    background-size: 150px 37px;
}

.logo-header {
    float: left;
}

.presentation {
    .media {
        height: auto;
        footer {
            margin-top: 15px;
        }
    }
}
```

Furthermore you can customize the header, footer, presentation and help of your
portal. To do that create a folder, generate files and then customize them.

```bash
mkdir themes/example/templates
cd themes/example/templates && touch _footer.ejs _header.ejs _presentation.ejs _help_about_items.ejs
```

## Admin Panel

Keyrock provides an interface in which administrators could easliy manage the
users accounts. Actions as create, edit, delete, enable users as well as reset
passwords of them could be performed through this functionality.
