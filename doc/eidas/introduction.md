# Introduction

Secure electronic identification (eID) is one of the key enablers of data
protection, privacy and the prevention of online fraud, especially in new areas
of application, like Smart Cities, where incorporating real identities into
trustable infrastructures has a huge potential.

eID can guarantee the unambiguous identification of a person and make it
possible to get the service delivered to the person who is really entitled to
it. The Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS)
Regulation provides a solution to European Member States for recognizing and
accepting eIDs issued in other Member States.

Technical specifications and reference implementations of the interoperability
nodes for the eID mechanisms were
[published as open source](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/european-system-recognition-electronic-identities-eidas)
on 26th November 2015 for the technological infrastructure under Connecting
Europe Facility (CEF) program.

The ultimate goal is to offer the possibility to EU citizens to use their
national eID in other EU countries when accessing public and private services
online.

The FIWARE identity - eIDAS authentication module that this GE offers allows CEF
eID transnational authentication of EU citizens by means of their national eID
in FIWARE based OAuth2 authentication domains.

Thus, every service deployed according FIWARE security basis, is now accessible
by european citizens using their eID and in a transparent way for service
providers.
