# Register your user account

In order to start using the FIWARE IdM, you must first register your own
account. You can see how to do that
[User & Programmers Manual](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_and_programmers_guide/user_guide/index.html#sign-in).

# Register your application

The next step is registering your own application. The `Callback URL` attribute
is a mandatory parameter used in OAuth2 authentication. The IdM provides you
with a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` which are used in OAuth2. You can see
how to do that
[User & Programmers Manual](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_and_programmers_guide/application_guide/index.html#register-an-application).
